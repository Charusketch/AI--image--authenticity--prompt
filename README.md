# AI Image Authenticity Analysis Prompt

## Overview
This repository contains a carefully designed prompt that helps analyze whether an image might be AI-generated or a real photograph.  
The analysis is intentionally **uncertain**, **non-technical**, and **beginner-friendly**, focusing only on visible visual cues.

This prompt does **not** claim absolute accuracy and does **not** present conclusions as facts.

---

## What This Prompt Does
- Analyzes an image based only on visible details
- Explains observations in simple, clear language
- Clearly states uncertainty and limitations
- Avoids technical jargon and overconfidence
- Uses a consistent and structured response format

---

## Intended Use
This prompt is intended for:
- Educational purposes
- Awareness about AI-generated images
- Beginners learning image analysis concepts
- Ethical and transparent AI usage

It is **not** meant to be used as a definitive verification tool.

---

## Response Structure
The prompt enforces the following response format:

- Brief summary (uncertain tone)
- Signs that could suggest AI-generation (if any)
- Signs that could suggest a real photo (if any)
- Overall assessment using cautious language such as  
  “leaning toward”, “more likely”, or “unclear”

---

## Important Limitations
- Visual analysis alone cannot guarantee accuracy
- High-quality editing, CGI, or staged photography may appear similar to AI-generated images
- The prompt explicitly avoids 100% certainty

---

## Authorship & Transparency
- The idea and concept for this prompt are original
- ChatGPT was used as a **tool** to help refine wording, structure, and clarity
- No prompts were copied from other creators

Using AI tools for drafting and refinement is a common and accepted practice.
